"""
Rock–Paper–Scissors Game 🎮
---------------------------
This is a simple Python program where:
- The user chooses Rock (r), Paper (p), or Scissor (s).
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- The program compares both choices and declares the result:
    - Draw if both are the same
    - User wins if their choice beats the computer
    - Computer wins otherwise
